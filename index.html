                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>GM! my name is João and I'm currently working on the most advanced and secure way of bringing BTC
                        to DeFi - with <a href="#native" onclick="showSection('native')">Native</a>.</p>
                    <p>I've been in the space for 3 years, focused on building mostly in the Bitcoin Ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>At Native I lead day-to-day biz dev strategies, which includes but not limited to partnerships,
                        gtm, operations, content, community, etc. In general, I believe I'm an instrumental piece in a
                        startup, having already 3+ startup experiences where I had to be resourceful and proactive.</p>
                    <p>I also consider myself a small degen, with my focus being on Sui, which is the most interesting
                        ecosystem at the moment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Native is the most advanced and secure way to bring BTC into DeFi, built specifically for
                            Sui.</strong></p>
                    <p class="justify">It uses a Zero Trust model and a new cutting-edge 2PC-MPC cryptography (developed
                        by Ika) to make Bitcoin usable on Sui without bridging, or wrapping. It’s fully decentralized,
                        non-custodial, and trust-minimized.</p>
                    <p class="justify"><strong>nBTC</strong> is how this happens, which is a 1:1 synthetic BTC on Sui,
                        redeemable at any time, with no middlemen or risk of loss.</p>
                    <p class="justify">For users, this all comes together through <strong>BYield</strong>, a simple and
                        easy to use interface to earn yield on Bitcoin with a single click. It eliminates and abstracts
                        all of the issues and barriers users might have, and delivers the best UX and UI for BTC to be
                        brought over to Sui's DeFi.</p>
                    <p class="justify">If you're holding BTC and want to earn with it, BYield is the easiest and safest
                        way to do it, powered by Native.</p>
